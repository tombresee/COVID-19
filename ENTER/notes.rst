Gene Sequencing Explained
=========================

Some high level basics... 

genome
  In the fields of molecular biology and genetics, a genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes (the coding regions) and the noncoding DNA, as well as mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA. The study of the genome is called genomics.

Code Blocks
-----------

Code blocks automatically pick up the declared language highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

    def func(x):
        return x

.. code-block:: javascript

    func(a, b) {
        return b, a
    }
